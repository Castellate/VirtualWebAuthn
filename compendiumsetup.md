# Compendium Setup
Compendium is still in development and as such is not released on any standard Python repository. The wheel and requirements are included in the repository. To install do the following:

```pip install -r compendium_requirements.txt```

followed by

```pip install Compendium-0.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl```

## Current Status
Usage of Compendium is still in development, this is currently just a proof of concept. Currently the enrolment is limited to a single device and there is no current UI for removing/resetting.
